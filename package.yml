# This file represents the root package of the application
# Please validate the configuration using `packwerk validate` (for Rails applications) or running the auto generated
# test case (for non-Rails projects). You can then use `packwerk check` to check your code.

# Types of boundary checks
# Packwerk ships with dependency boundary checking only. Other checking support may be added by extension gems.

# Enforcing dependency boundary
# A package's dependency boundary is violated whenever it references a constant in some package that has not been declared as a dependency.

# Specify enforce_dependencies: true to start enforcing the dependencies of a package. The intentional dependencies of the package are specified as a list under a dependencies: key.

enforce_dependencies: true
enforce_privacy: true
dependencies:
  - packs/user_management
  - packs/reservations
